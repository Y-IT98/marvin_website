                    <h1>Banff Blog</h1>
                    <p>Recently I made a quick trip to Banff as I had not explored mcuh within Canada. </p>
                    <p>I went for 3 days, booked a stay in a hotel as well as rented a car for the duration of my stay because I really wanted to get the most out of my time.</p>
                    <p>The flight from Vancouver was fairly early as I left at 4:30 am and got to Alberta at 6 am. </p>
                    <p>I had a few things on my itinerary that I really wanted to knock off of my list, I was also limited to how many things I
                    could do in the couple of days I was here so I did the following.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pickup the rental car after leaving the airport</li>
                        <li>Check into my hotel</li>
                        <li>Drive into Banff and explore the mountains</li>
                        <li>Ask the locals for any recommendations outside the typical landmarks</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>The Stay</h2>
                    <p>Things went relatively according to my plan above except for the kind of car I ended up getting. Originally
                    I had booked a sedan but when I got to the car lot they mentioned that they only had either  a pickup truck or a minivan.</p>
                    <p>The choice here was an obvious one. I <strong>instantly</strong> took the pickup truck and was off onto the highway.</p>
                    <p>This pickup truck added quite a bit of excitement for me for 2 reasons one being I've never driven one before and two was I was so tired from the flight that I
                    ended up sleeping in the truck and surprisingly it was quite comfortable.</p>
                    <p>To illustrate the difference between the truck and my current vehicle I will have a brief comparison table below to illustrate. That will be the last you'll hear about this truck I promise.</p>

                    <h2>Mountain Hike</h2>
                    <p>After getting some much needed rest, I wasted no time after my checkin at the hotel as I wanted to see the Canadian rockies for myself.</p>
                    <p>I had spend a fair bit of my time at the start of this year hiking in Vancouver, Cypress, Whistler and the usual suspects. While the mountains in vancouver are beautiful,
                    The view of Banff from the Tunnel mountain was quite breathtaking.</p>
                    <p>It was absolutely beautiful during the day but I also managed to get some pictures after sunset and I still cant decide which was better.</p>
                    <p>Of course I will put these pictures here and let you decide for yourself.</p>
                    <h2>Town Sightseeing</h2>
                    <p>After I spent my first day exploring the mountains and hiking, I spent my second day here driving around town and just walking around.</p>
                    <p>Luckily it wasn't freezing cold outside so i could actually tolerate being out for that long. I asked the locals for some food recommendations and they told me about this pizza place that did not disappoint.</p>
                    <p>It was an italian spot called Lupo and it was ranked 6th in Canada's best top 10 new restaurants in 2023. The food definitely confirmed that ranking.</p>
                    <p>The last spot I had time to visit was this bar on my way to the airport. The ambiance and the atmosphere there was quite nice. A very visually appealing layout, definitely worth the stop before I made my way to the airport later that evening.</p>
